It's all the same, only the names will change
Every day, it seems we're wastin' away
Another place where the faces are so cold
I'd drive all night just to get back home
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
Wanted dead or alive
Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days
The people I meet always go their separate ways
Sometimes you tell the day by the bottle that you drink
And times when you're alone, well, all you do is think
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted (wanted), dead or alive
Wanted (wanted), dead or alive
Oh, and I ride
Yeah
Oh, I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted (wanted), dead or alive
And I walk these streets, a loaded six-string on my back
I play for keeps 'cause I might not make it back
I've been everywhere, still I'm standing tall
I've seen a million faces and I've rocked them all
'Cause I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted (wanted), dead or alive

Leaves you baby if you don't care for it
Did I disappoint you?
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without
Well it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One!
Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus?
To the lepers in your head
Did I ask too much? More than a lot
You gave me nothin' now it's all I got
We're one but we're not the same
Well we hurt each other then we do it again
You say love is a temple, love a higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holdin' on to what you got
When all you got is hurt
One love, one blood
One life, you got to do what you should
One life, with each other

Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war
For a leading role in a cage?
How I wish, how I wish you were here

Swimming in a fish bowl

Running over the same old ground
What have we found?

So hold my hand, I'll walk with you my dear

It's the house telling you to close your eyes
And some days I can't even dress myself
It's killing me to see you this way
'Cause though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore
There's an old voice in my head
That's holding me back
Well, tell her that I miss our little talks
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young
And full of life and full of love
Some days I don't know if I am wrong or right
Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear
'Cause though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore
Don't listen to a word I say
(Hey)
The screams all sound the same
(Hey)
And though the truth may vary
This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore
You're gone, gone, gone away
I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart
There's nothing we can do
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon
Now wait, wait, wait for me, please hang around
I'll see you when I fall asleep

Just a little patience, yeah
Some more patience, yeah (I've been walking the streets at night)
Just trying to get it right (A little patience, yeah)
It's hard to see with so many around
You know I don't like being stuck in the crowd (Could use some patience, yeah)
And the streets don't change but maybe the names
I ain't got time for the game 'cause I need you (Gotta have more patience, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah but I need you (All need more patience)
Oh, I need you (All need some patience)
Oh, I need you (Just a little patience)
Ooh this time (Is all you need)`,

      lyrics: `
Well, I started out
Down a dirty road
Started out all alone
And the sun went down
As I crossed the hill
And the town lit up
The world got still
I'm learning to fly
But I ain't got wings
Coming down
Is the hardest thing
Well the good ol' days
May not return
And the rocks might melt
And the sea may burn
I'm learning to fly
(I'm learning to fly)
But I ain't got wings
(I'm learning to fly)
And coming down
(I'm learning to fly)
Is the hardest thing
(I'm learning to fly)
Now some say life
Will beat you down
Yeah, break your heart
Steal your crown
So I started out
For God knows where
I guess I'll know
When I get there
I'm learning to fly
Around the clouds
But what goes up
Must come down
I'm learning to fly
(I'm learning to fly)
But I ain't got wings
Coming down
Is the hardest thing
I'm learning to fly
(I'm learning to fly)
Around the clouds
But what goes up
(I'm learning to fly)
Must come down`,

      lyrics: `
Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness
Like a heartbeat, drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
And what you lost
Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know
Now here I go again, I see the crystal vision
I keep my visions to myself
But it's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams, and
Have you any dreams you'd like to sell, dreams of loneliness?
Like a heartbeat, drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
Ooh, what you lost
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know
You will know
Oh-oh-oh, you'll know`,

There is a town in north Ontario
With dream comfort memory to spare
In my mind, I still need a place to go
All my changes were there
Blue, blue windows behind the stars
Yellow moon on the rise
Big birds flying across the sky
Throwing shadows on our eyes
Leave us
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Baby can you hear me now? (Helpless, helpless, helpless)
The chains are locked and tied across the door
Baby, sing with me somehow (helpless, helpless, helpless)
Blue, blue windows behind the stars
Yellow moon on the rise
Big birds flying across the sky
Throwing shadows on our eyes
Leave us
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Helpless, helpless, helpless

Uzun, ince bir yoldayım
Gediyorum gündüz gece
Bilmiyorum ne hâldeyim
Gediyorum gündüz gece

Bilmiyorum ne hâldeyim
Gediyorum gündüz gece
Gündüz gece
Gündüz gece
Gündüz gece, hey
Dünyaya geldiğim anda
Yörüdüm aynı zemanda
İki gapılı bir handa
Gediyorum gündüz gece
Gündüz gece
Gündüz gece
Gündüz gece, hey
Düşünülürse derince
Uzak gözükür görünce
Yol bir dak'ka, mıktarınca
Gediyorum gündüz gece
Gündüz gece
Gündüz gece
Gündüz gece`,
