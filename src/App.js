Is it getting better?
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you now?
You got someone to blame
You say, one love, one life
When it's one need in the night
One love, we get to share it
Leaves you baby if you don't care for it
Did I disappoint you?
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without
Well it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One!
Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus?
To the lepers in your head
Did I ask too much? More than a lot
You gave me nothin' now it's all I got
We're one but we're not the same
Well we hurt each other then we do it again
You say love is a temple, love a higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holdin' on to what you got
When all you got is hurt
One love, one blood
One life, you got to do what you should
One life, with each other
Sisters, brothers
One life but we're not the same

Hey, where did we go?
Days when the rains came
Down in the hollow
Playin' a new game
Laughin' and a-runnin', hey, hey
Skippin' and a-jumpin'
In the misty morning fog with
Our, our hearts a-thumping and you
My brown-eyed girl
And you, my brown-eyed girl
And whatever happened
To Tuesday and so slow?
Going down the old mine with a
Transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hiding 'hind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and sliding
All along the waterfall with you
My brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl
Do you remember when we used to sing?
Sha-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la tee-da
Just like that
Sha-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la tee-da, la-tee-da
So hard to find my way
Now that I'm all on my own
I saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown
Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometimes I'm overcome thinking 'bout it
Making love in the green grass
Behind the stadium with you
My brown-eyed girl
You, my brown-eyed girl

      One, two, one, two, three, four
      Shed a tear 'cause I'm missin' you
      I'm still alright to smile
      Girl, I think about you every day now
      Was a time when I wasn't sure
      But you set my mind at ease
      There is no doubt you're in my heart now
      Said "woman take it slow, and it'll work itself out fine"
      All we need is just a little patience
      Said "sugar make it slow and we'll come together fine"
      All we need is just a little patience (Patience)
      Mm, yeah
      I sit here on the stairs
      'Cause I'd rather be alone
      If I can't have you right now, I'll wait dear
      Sometimes I get so tense but I can't speed up the time
      But you know love there's one more thing to consider
      Said "woman take it slow and things will be just fine"
      You and I'll just use a little patience
      Said "sugar take the time 'cause the lights are shining bright"
      You and I've got what it takes to make it
      We won't fake it, I'll never break it
      'Cause I can't take it
      Little patience, mm yeah, mm yeah
      Need a little patience, yeah
      Just a little patience, yeah
      Some more patience, yeah (I've been walking the streets at night)
      Just trying to get it right (A little patience, yeah)
      It's hard to see with so many around
      You know I don't like being stuck in the crowd (Could use some patience, yeah)
      And the streets don't change but maybe the names
      I ain't got time for the game 'cause I need you (Gotta have more patience, yeah)
      Yeah, yeah, yeah but I need you (All need more patience)
      Oh, I need you (All need some patience)
      Oh, I need you (Just a little patience)
      Ooh this time (Is all you need)`),

Well, I started out
Down a dirty road
Started out all alone
And the sun went down
As I crossed the hill
And the town lit up
The world got still
I'm learning to fly
But I ain't got wings
Coming down
Is the hardest thing
Well the good ol' days
May not return
And the rocks might melt
And the sea may burn
I'm learning to fly
(I'm learning to fly)
But I ain't got wings
(I'm learning to fly)
And coming down
(I'm learning to fly)
Is the hardest thing
(I'm learning to fly)
Now some say life
Will beat you down
Yeah, break your heart
Steal your crown
So I started out
For God knows where
I guess I'll know
When I get there
I'm learning to fly
Around the clouds
But what goes up
Must come down
I'm learning to fly
(I'm learning to fly)
But I ain't got wings
Coming down
Is the hardest thing
I'm learning to fly
(I'm learning to fly)
Around the clouds

      Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom
      Well, who am I to keep you down?
      It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
      But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness
      Like a heartbeat, drives you mad
      In the stillness of remembering what you had
      And what you lost
      And what you had
      And what you lost
      Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
      Players only love you when they're playing
      Say, women, they will come and they will go
      When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
      You'll know
      Now here I go again, I see the crystal vision
      I keep my visions to myself
      But it's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams, and
      Have you any dreams you'd like to sell, dreams of loneliness?
      Like a heartbeat, drives you mad

There is a town in north Ontario
With dream comfort memory to spare
In my mind, I still need a place to go
All my changes were there
Blue, blue windows behind the stars
Yellow moon on the rise
Big birds flying across the sky
Throwing shadows on our eyes
Leave us
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Baby can you hear me now? (Helpless, helpless, helpless)
The chains are locked and tied across the door
Baby, sing with me somehow (helpless, helpless, helpless)
Blue, blue windows behind the stars
Yellow moon on the rise
Big birds flying across the sky
Throwing shadows on our eyes
Leave us
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Helpless, helpless, helpless
Helpless, helpless, helpless
